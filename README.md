1 topic

Dungeon – stores a list of rooms and controls the game.
Room – describes each room.
NPC – stores the name of the character (but is not used in the game yet).
MUDBuilderDemo – creates a dungeon and starts the game.

How the code works
A dungeon is created (Dark Cave)

It consists of several rooms, each with its own description.
Some rooms can have special events, such as a fight with a monster or falling into an abyss.

The game shows a description of the current room.
The player enters a command (next, left, right) to move on.
The game checks where to go

If the player gets into a dangerous room (for example, falls into an abyss), the game ends (Game Over).
If a player reaches a room with a victory event (e.g. defeating a monster and finding treasure), the game declares victory (Congratulations!).
